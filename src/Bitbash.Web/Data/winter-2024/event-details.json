Many companies benefit from their machine data by optimizing their processes with remote monitoring and predictive maintenance.\r\n\r\n,,But I don\u0027t know anything about IoT. How should I start? How do I get value from incoming raw telemetry?\u0027\u0027\r\n\r\nThe best way to learn it is to experience it!\r\n\r\nWithin this half-day workshop, you\u0027ll follow the scenario in which a remote coffee machine is connected to Azure for monitoring and management of issues. You can monitor device telemetry such as water temperature and water level, observe the state of your machine, set the optimal temperature, and send commands. Next to that, you learn how to query the data using KQL and use that for building simple but effective dashboards.\r\n\r\nWith this introduction, you will get an idea of the basic IoT principles by hands-on experience with a simulated device, Azure IoT Hub, Azure Data Explorer and Visual Studio Code. So, bring your laptop and prepare yourself for future IoT related cases and telemetry exploration within your organization.\r\n\r\nYou will turn your laptop into a coffeemaker.

In this talk, I\u0027d like you to show you common sources of unnecessary coupling and offer you options to help prevent and/or break those. I\u0027ll talk about how principles like Don\u0027t Repeat Yourself and Dependency Injection can be a double-edge sword, how to detect too unnecessary dependencies and how to use the Dependency Inversion Principle to unravel some of those.

      "Description": "Several studies shown that round 80% of our applications consist of other people\u0027s code because why would you re-create something that\u0027s already made by someone else? But with using a NuGet Package that is developed by others, we also put a lot of trust in it, which might result in bigger security problems later. Of course, it\u0027s always a good idea to get updates of libraries in case of a bug fix related to a functional and/or security issue found. But will that be enough? What about packages that have malicious code inside? Even related to your own supply-chain security, any problem in the package its supply-chain implicitly means your supply-chain is compromised as well!\r\nWould it not be nice if there is a better way to review NuGet packages for security? An easier way to perform an assessment based on certain aspects of the package that will tell you more about the package its software security. With the introduction of Scorecards the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) exactly tries to achieve that. You could consider a Scorecard being the equivalent of a nutrition labels put on food you buy in a supermarket. It will allow you to see what\u0027s inside and determine if you want to eat it or not.\r\nIn this session we start out with different area\u0027s covered by of OpenSSF Scorecards, like how well it\u0027s maintained, does the build have dangerous workflows, and does the project use other security tools to check for problems? We\u0027re also going to identify additional area\u0027s for NuGet packages in which we could add additional information related to reproducibility, insights on what .NET APIs are used, and security review of the codebase. All combined will give us the ability to assess a NuGet package its security posture more easily and improve our own application security.",

      "Description": "Over the last few years, a lot of attention has been paid to building (engineering) platforms. But how do you manage access to your environments for engineers?  Do you even manage this with the same rigor as you manage application security? And how to find the balance between security and usability?\r\n\r\nIn this session, Henry will explore with you how he has solved this at his customers. We will take a look at Entra ID Access Packages and Privileged Identity Management and see how we can apply those in a practical design that allows for self-service requests for access, approvals by their peers or a manager, automatic access reviews, and much more!",

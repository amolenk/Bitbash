Platform engineering fixes this by giving teams one open-source, cloud native platform that hides the hard parts and offers ready-made golden paths. This approach lowers cognitive load and helps developers ship faster. \r\n\r\nSelf-service platforms are on the rise and a lot of companies are building them from scratch hoping their developers will come and use it. We believe you can use existing open-source tools to compose a platform and spend your time designing the services you want to offer to your developers. \r\n\r\nIn this full-day workshop you will build such a platform, starting on a small local Kubernetes cluster and finishing on Azure, setting up the groundwork so you can take the lessons back to your workplace to focus on implementing the services that your company needs. \r\n\r\nWhat we will cover:\r\n\r\nBuild a cloud native internal engineering platform with CNCF projects \u0026 Kubernetes clusters created locally for zero-cost experiments, then repeated on Azure Kubernetes Service for real world scale. \r\n\r\nAdopt GitOps with Argo CD so the cluster always follows what is in Git, giving safe and fast releases. \r\n\r\nLearn about tools such as Azure Service Operator, Crossplane, Terranetes \u0026 KRO and how they can help you design automated self-service scenarios. \r\n\r\nCreate golden path templates in Backstage that let a developer generate a new service repo, pipeline, and manifests in one click. \r\n\r\nShow a clear return on investment and gather facts you can use to convince leaders to fund a platform team. \r\n\r\nDeploy a service from commit to traffic and watch every step in the portal and GitOps dashboard, proving the value in minutes. \r\n\r\nLearning objectives:\r\n\r\n- Learn how platform engineering can cut developer cognitive load by providing a single self-service engineering platform. \r\n\r\n- Automate build and release with GitOps, Argo CD, and Backstage templates. \r\n\r\n- Learn to navigate the CNCF landscape regarding platform engineering with tools like Argo, Crossplane, Backstage, Azure Service Operator, Terranetes \u0026 KRO \r\n\r\n- Build a short business case that secures support for a platform team in your company. \r\n\r\nPrerequisites \r\n\r\n- A laptop that can run Docker \r\n- A GitHub account \r\n- Basic command-line knowledge \r\n- An Azure Account you can use\r\n- Any existing Kubernetes knowledge would speed things up but is not required ",

Copilot is more than just pressing TAB to autocomplete snippets. It can support you through the entire development cycle.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we explore how to use Copilot across the entire Dev cycle. A big part of this is context engineering: teaching the AI about your domain, your codebase, and your goals so its suggestions are more accurate and valuable. We\u2019ll see how Copilot can help with creating backlog items, designing implementation plans, writing real code, generating tests, reviewing pull requests, and producing documentation.\r\n\r\nThrough a live demo, we\u2019ll show you how to implement a production-ready feature using AI at every stage. You\u0027ll learn where GitHub Copilot shines, where it struggles, and how to make most of its capabilities.\r\n\r\nIf you are already experimenting with AI-Augmented programming and want to unlock its full potential, this talk will give you the insights and techniques you need.",

Yet this is often the environment we face in complex software projects where stakeholders have conflicting interests, and political alliances may be unknown.\r\nComplex and ever-changing environments can leave teams paralysed. It is tempting to oversimplify in complex situations to achieve clarity and determine the best course of action.  However, this can create dangerous blind spots that lead to the underestimation of critical risks or a waste of resources.\r\nThis talk introduces different approaches to complex decision-making. Instead of seeking perfect solutions, it will help you find \u201Cthe next best move\u201D by making incremental and reversible decisions. By embracing complexity rather than fighting it, you might discover that navigating uncertainty can deliver its own kind of dopamine hit!",
